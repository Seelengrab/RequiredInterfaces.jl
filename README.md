RequiredInterfaces.jl is a small package, allowing abstract-type based definition of interface methods, as well as
some methods for checking whether a type that claims to implement an interface, actually implements the required methods.

Please check out the [documentation](https://seelengrab.github.io/RequiredInterfaces.jl/) to learn how you can use RequiredInterfaces.jl to provide basic "implement me" style interfaces in your library.
